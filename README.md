# this-keyword-lab
In this lab I practiced using the 'this' keyword in manipulating different DOM elements.  The first exercise I practiced using one function to change the color of many buttons using 'this'.  Using the 'this' method I reduced the amount of code I need and call the correct attribute.  In the second exercise I practiced using the data-color attribute that can be bound to the 'this' keyword essentially reducing code and pointing to the correct element.  The third exercise shows that when a function calls another function the 'this' is lost.  Therefore we use the bind() to actually bin to the correct function oject.  Lastly in exercise 4 I learned that arrow functions do not have their own 'this' keyword so we must use another method.  The method I practiced was the event.currentTarget that targets the element that is attached to the event listener.
